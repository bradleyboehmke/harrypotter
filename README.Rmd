## An R Package for J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter Series

This package provides access to the full texts of the first seven Harry Potter books. The UTF-8 plain text for each novel was sourced from [Read Vampire Books]([www.readbooksvampire.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20170603205600/http://readbooksvampire.com/)), processed a bit, and is ready for text analysis. Each text is in a character vector with each element representing a single chapter. The package contains:

- `philosophers_stone`: Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone, published in 1997
- `chamber_of_secrets`: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, published in 1998
- `prisoner_of_azkaban`: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, published in 1999
- `goblet_of_fire`: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, published in 2000
- `order_of_the_phoenix`: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, published in 2003
